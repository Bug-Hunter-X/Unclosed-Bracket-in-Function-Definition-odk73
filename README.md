This repository contains a simple Python code example demonstrating a common syntax error: an unclosed bracket in a function definition.  The `bug.py` file showcases the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected version. This is a good example of how even simple syntax errors can cause significant problems and halt execution.
